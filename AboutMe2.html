<h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
<p>My favorite hobby woud have to be reading. Ever since I could remember, my parents strongly encouraged me to read and surrounded me with books. We have several bookcases at home, and I have definitely read the majority of the books in them. I remember in middle school that I would bring a book to school just so I can read it when there wa downtime during class. I believe this habit has helped me tremendously in constantly pursuing education and enriching myself.
